# MatchZy Demo Upload Service

This service is designed to handle automated uploads of demo files from the MatchZy plugin for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive servers.

## Setting Up Your Environment

To get started with the MatchZy Demo Upload Service:

1. **Copy `.env.example` to a New File:**
   Copy the `.env.example` file to a new file named `.env`. This can be done with the following command:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. **Configure Your Environment Variables:**
   Open the `.env` file in a text editor and replace the placeholder values with your actual configurations.

## MatchZy Plugin

This service works in conjunction with the [MatchZy Plugin](https://github.com/shobhit-pathak/MatchZy), which is responsible for sending demos to this webserver. A big thank you to [Shobhit Pathak](https://github.com/shobhit-pathak) for creating the MatchZy plugin.
